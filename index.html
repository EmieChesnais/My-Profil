			<p>Hello!! My Name is Emie Chesnais. I was born in Singapour and raised in France. I have led a pretty international life a. Also, as i've constantly visiting many places around the world throughout my vacations, Kenya and Sri-Lanka being one of my favourite places, I have become curious🤠 and open-minded. I'm currently living in Ermont,and I'm studying a degree in Business Administration at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School.</p>

			<h2>MY ASSOCIATIONS</h2>
			<p> I'm currently a member of two associations in ESSEC. One of them is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100007355265829" target="_blank">ESSEC España</a> which consists of an international association created to promote Hispanic culture and traditions among the ESSEC student community. My role, as a member of the communication and event department, is mainly the creation of digital content to promote the association and events organized to promote Hispanic culture at ESSEC.<p/>

			<p> I'm also a member of a citizen/caricative associsation called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rota.ractclubessec" target="_blank">ROTARACT</a>. Here, I’m in charge of managing the Instagram and Facebook accounts and I create digital content to promote the association.  Also, I help to organise events, mainly for charitable purposes and to raise funds and awareness.</p>

			<h2>✈️TRAVEL✈️</h2>
			<p> I love travelling, discovering new cultures, meeting new people,etc. In my opinion, seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college clas. When we travel, we have the possibility of learning a new language, a new cuisine, aspects of a different culture, or even acquiring a deeper appreciation of faith or spirituality. </p>

			<p>Also, I feel like travelling helps to open your mind. You realize that there’s no one way to live life. Especially, meeting people from other places will show you that your world view isn’t the same as everyone else’s.</p>

			<p>I personally prefer to visit places where the weather is warm, such as Formentera (little island next to Ibiza), Bali, Spain, Greece, Turkey... Nonethless, since I love skiing and the snow as well as exploring different environments and places I tend to like all the places I visit. For instance, I went to Switzerland with my best-friends to visit her family a few weeks ago, and I couldn't beleive how beautiful was the landcape that I was 24/7 starring at, whether it was thorugh the windows or while walking around.</p>

			<h2>💪🏼MY SPORTY LIFE💪🏼</h2>
			<p align=”justify”>I'm a very active and enthusiastic girl, so sports make part of my dialy life. I have done many sports throughout my whole life apart from climbing. These include horse riding, dance,skiing, swimming, etc. There's not a single sport so far, out of these, that I haven't enjoyed.</p>

			<p align=”justify”>I believe sports have contributed a lot to my personal growth and character. They've increased my self-esteem, improved my social skills and leadership abilities, my resilience and developed a positive attitude towards hard moments. Sports have taught me that failing is completely normal when learning something new, to respect the opponents and Fairplay among many other things.</p>

			<p align=”justify”> Overall, without sports, I wouldn't have become who I currently am; I feel they're part of my personality.</p>
